## 什么时候需要异步

## Concurrency And Parallelism

### Difference

Certainly! Here's a table highlighting the key differences between concurrency and parallelism:

|   Concurrency   |   Parallelism   |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Deals with managing multiple tasks that are executing sequentially or overlapping in time. | Deals with performing multiple tasks simultaneously by utilizing multiple resources. |
| Focuses on efficient utilization of system resources by switching between tasks. | Focuses on executing tasks concurrently using multiple threads or processes. |
| Enables efficient multitasking, allowing multiple tasks to make progress even if they don't run simultaneously. | Enables tasks to run simultaneously, improving overall throughput and performance. |
| Typically involves a single processor or core, where tasks are interleaved or scheduled to run. | Involves multiple processors or cores, where tasks are executed in parallel, each on a separate resource. |
| Enables better responsiveness and improved user experience, as tasks can be scheduled and interleaved efficiently. | Enables faster execution and completion of tasks by utilizing available resources effectively. |
| Useful in scenarios where tasks involve I/O-bound operations, such as network requests or file operations. | Beneficial for CPU-bound tasks, such as heavy computational operations or data processing. |
| Coordination and synchronization between tasks are essential to avoid conflicts and ensure correctness. | Coordination and synchronization may still be required, but tasks can be executed independently without interference. |

It's important to note that concurrency and parallelism are related concepts but serve different purposes. Concurrency focuses on task management and efficient resource utilization, while parallelism aims at executing tasks simultaneously to improve overall performance.

同时也要明白 Parallelism.
