## Understand the Context
Exploratory vs. explanatory analysis

In Exploratory way, we need to test different ways to explore the data.

Exploratory analysis is used to understand the data and find interesting insights, while explanatory analysis is used to tell a specific story and communicate the findings to the audience.
　
We need to use exploratory way first to find the "pearl", then we need to use explantory way　
　
　
　
 to show our data.
